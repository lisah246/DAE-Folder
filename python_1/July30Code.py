# Lisa's Python Project: Adventure Game
# Background: Introductory game for kids to learn math, technology, and basic reasoning skills.

import random
import sys
import json

"""Import (bring into your program) three Python standard libraries so you can use their built-in functions:

random

Provides functions to generate random numbers or randomly choose items.

In your game, it‚Äôs used to pick random quiz questions and hazards to keep the gameplay unpredictable.

sys

Gives access to system-specific parameters and functions.

In your code, it‚Äôs mainly used for sys.exit(), which cleanly ends the game program when needed (like quitting or game over).

json

Lets you work with JSON data (JavaScript Object Notation), a common format to store and exchange data.

Your game uses it to save and load the game state from a file (savegame.json), so players can continue where they left off.

So basically, these imports give your code handy tools to run the game smoothly, handle randomness, quit properly, and save/load data."""
