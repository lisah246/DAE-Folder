# Prompt Engineering Documentation

## Project Goal
Build a text-based survival adventure game with a Tkinter GUI. The player navigates rooms, solves challenges, and survives hazards.

## Initial Prompt Design Objectives
- Generate an adventure game idea using Tkinter
- Help structure a 2-week project schedule
- Design flowchart and algorithm
- Get guidance on logic validation and scoring system

## Prompt Examples and AI Responses

**Prompt #1:**
"Can you help me design a 2-week project that includes Python, Tkinter, Git, and flowcharts?"
→ *AI provided full breakdown and schedule.*

**Prompt #2:**
"Can you generate a flowchart from this algorithm?"
→ *AI returned image + FigJam-ready version.*

**Prompt #3:**
"What does 'Begin writing prompt documentation' mean?"
→ *Clarified and gave examples like this section.*

## Notes:
- Track any hallucinations (e.g., AI gave flawed logic or misread requirement — note it and how you corrected it)
- Track where AI helped with **programming**, **text generation**, and **image generation**

## Multimodal Use Evidence
- Programming: Python logic, Tkinter GUI
- Text Generation: Schedule, rubric tracker, documentation
- Image Generation: Flowchart visual
